# CSI - Control Surface Integrator

Welcome to the primary code repository for the **CSI (Control Surface Integrator)** project!

CSI is a powerful and flexible system for integrating a wide range of hardware control surfaces with [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/), providing advanced mapping, feedback, and workflow customization capabilities. Whether you're using a basic MIDI controller or a complex multi-surface studio setup, CSI enables deep control over your DAW environment.

CSI is a fully open-source project. Anyone is welcome to explore, contribute to, or fork the codebase to create customized builds that meet their specific needs.

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome and encouraged!**

We kindly ask that contributors follow these guidelines to help keep the project organized and moving forward smoothly:

- **Introduce yourself!**  
  Feel free to reach out to the team before beginning work. This helps avoid conflicts with project goals or other contributors who may already be working on related tasks.

- **Align with project goals.**  
  Before making major changes, please check in to make sure your ideas fit with the long-term direction of the project.

- **Keep Pull Requests (PRs) focused and small.**  
  PRs should ideally cover a **single feature or fix**.  
  This makes reviewing and testing changes much easier.

- **Include clear explanations.**  
  When submitting a PR, please describe:
  - The purpose of the change
  - Why the change is necessary
  - How the change is used (especially if it relates to a specific surface)
  - Any relevant zone or syntax information

- **Do not remove project files** without prior discussion.  
  Project files (such as Visual Studio solutions, WDL components, etc.) are important for cross-platform builds and ongoing development. Please avoid deleting or replacing these files unless the change has been discussed and agreed upon by the team.

- **PR review process.**  
  Regular CSI contributors will review and approve pull requests to ensure consistency, compatibility, and project integrity.

## Forks and Custom Versions

Because CSI is open source, anyone is free to clone this repository and create their own builds incorporating any changes, large or small.  
If you have ideas that significantly diverge from the current project goals, you're welcome to maintain your own fork!
